# Run Button

A fun little desktop app where the button *literally runs away* when you try to click it!

## 🎮 How It Works

- On **Desktop**: The button runs away from your mouse when you hover over it.
- On **Mobile**: The button dodges your finger when you try to tap it.

Built using **Java Swing**, just for fun (and frustration 😆).

## 📦 Features

- Interactive UI with unpredictable button movement
- Responsive to both desktop and mobile
- Great for pranking your friends or testing your patience
